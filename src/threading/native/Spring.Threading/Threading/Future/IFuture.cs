    /// Methods are provided to check if the computation is
    /// complete, to wait for its completion, and to retrieve the result of
    /// the computation.  The result can only be retrieved using method
    /// <see cref="GetResult()"/> when the computation has completed, blocking if
    /// necessary until it is ready.  Cancellation is performed by the
    /// <see cref="ICancellable.Cancel()"/> method.  Additional methods are provided to
    /// determine if the task completed normally or was cancelled. Once a
    /// computation has completed, the computation cannot be cancelled.

    /// of cancellability but not provide a usable result, you can
