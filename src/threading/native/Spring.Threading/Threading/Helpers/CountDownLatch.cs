    /// A <see cref="Spring.Threading.Helpers.CountDownLatch"/> is a versatile synchronization tool

    /// <see cref="Spring.Threading.Helpers.CountDownLatch"/> initialized with a count of one serves as a

    /// A useful property of a <see cref="Spring.Threading.Helpers.CountDownLatch"/> is that it
    /// doesn't require that threads calling <see cref="Spring.Threading.Helpers.CountDownLatch.CountDown()"/> wait for
    /// the count to reach zero before proceeding, it simply prevents any
    /// thread from proceeding past an <see cref="Spring.Threading.Helpers.CountDownLatch.Await()"/> and <see cref="Spring.Threading.Helpers.CountDownLatch.Await(TimeSpan)"/> until all

    /// <li>The second is a completion signal that allows the driver to wait
